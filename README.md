## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Online Retail Dataset**, which contains transaction data for an online retail store. The dataset includes information such as:
- Invoice numbers
- Stock codes
- Product descriptions
- Quantities
- Invoice dates
- Unit prices
- Customer IDs
- Countries

The analysis is divided into the following sections:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset, cleaning data, and visualizing key trends.
2. **RFM Analysis:** Segmenting customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
3. **Market Basket Analysis:** Identifying frequently purchased product combinations.
4. **Time-Based Analysis:** Analyzing sales trends over time (hourly, daily, monthly).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Online Retail Dataset**, available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/352/online+retail.zip). It contains transaction data from December 2010 to December 2011 for a UK-based online retail store.

### Dataset Columns
- **InvoiceNo:** Invoice number (unique identifier for each transaction).
- **StockCode:** Product code (unique identifier for each product).
- **Description:** Product description.
- **Quantity:** Quantity of each product in the transaction.
- **InvoiceDate:** Date and time of the transaction.
- **UnitPrice:** Price of each product.
- **CustomerID:** Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Country:** Country where the transaction occurred.

## Features

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualization of sales trends, top products, and top customers.
- Geographic analysis of sales by country.

### 2. **RFM Analysis**
- Customer segmentation based on:
  - **Recency:** How recently a customer made a purchase.
  - **Frequency:** How often a customer makes a purchase.
  - **Monetary:** How much money a customer spends.
- Visualization of customer segments.

### 3. **Market Basket Analysis**
- Identification of frequently purchased product combinations using the **Apriori algorithm**.
- Generation of association rules to understand product relationships.

### 4. **Time-Based Analysis**
- Analysis of sales trends by hour, day of the week, and month.
- Visualization of peak sales periods.
